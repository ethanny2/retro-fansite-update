						<p id="first_par">Jordan Carter, or as he's better known Playboi Carti, is an up and coming Atlanta born rapper that is at the forefront of
						this generation's Soundcloud rap movement. Born September 13,1996 in Atlanta Georgia, Jordan Carter attended North Springs
						high school where he was a member of the school's basketball team. Due to an argument  with the basketball team's coach
						Jordan left the team and began focusing on rapping. Soon after Jordan created his first rap on Garage Band called Cry under
						the name 'Sir Cartier'. The song was met with praise from Jordan's peers, and Jordan continued to release a stream of 
						songs in high school while working retail jobs at a variety of places.</p>
						<p id="second_par">Soon after graduating from North 
						Springs in 2014 and garnering thousands of plays on his Soundcloud tracks, Jordan was signed to Awful Records under the
						new name Playboi Carti. Awful Records was a group that included other big names in the underground rap community such as 
						Father and Ethereal. On April 2, 2015 Carti in collaboration with Awful Record producers made their first breakout hit "Brokeboi". The song was an immediate hit on both Soundcloud and Atlanta
						, but it was not until Carti met with fashion designer and social media personality Ian Connor that he really started
						to take off.</p>
						<p id="third_par">Ian and Carti claim to have known each other through their shared sense of fashion, it was by chance one day
						that Ian heard a song of Carti's and decidedly  pronounced him as the next big thing. With the help of Ian's connections
						to the A$AP Mob, Carti eventually left Awful Records and signed to A$AP Rocky.
						Together with A$AP Mob Carti has allegedly  collaborated with a series of big names such as Frank Ocean and Skepta. Carti
						was featured on the recent A$AP Mob mixtape Cozy Tapes mixtape and later signed a deal with Interscope Records.</p>
						<p id="fourth_par">Playboi 
						Carti's debut mixtape Ca$h Carti has been in production for reportedly nearly 2 years, as Carti and his friends tease
						fans with snippets from unreleased songs that feature the likes of Lil Uzi, Migo's Quavo and more. Despite Carti's nearly non-existent social media presence, fans continue to anticipate the release of his debut mixtape while frequently
						checking their Soundcloud feeds for any new Carti songs.</p>
